# Taxi Fare Prediction

## Taxi Fare Guru: Total Amount Prediction Challenge

### Introduction
This repository contains my work for the Kaggle competition "Taxi Fare Prediction Challenge". The goal of the competition is to predict the fare amount for a taxi ride in New York City given various features such as trip distance, passenger count, and payment type.

### Responsibilities
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- Developed and tuned multiple machine learning models:
  - Linear Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Extra Trees
  - XGBoost
  - Multilayer Perceptron
- Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.

### Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Results
- Achieved the highest RÂ² score of 0.914 with the Multilayer Perceptron model.
- Detailed model performance and analysis can be found in the `results/` directory.
